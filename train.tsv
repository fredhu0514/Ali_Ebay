6	Still setting up my store, and after initially paying for another search app, I made the decision to try Instant Search.   Their aesthetic really suits my type of store, and the custom settings provide you with so many options.  I am new to all of this, and am so happy I found this app.
7	This is an excellent search app, which they have well designed functions to help merchant to uplift customer's online searching experience. Furthermore, they have one of the best customer services supports to provide valuable advise, as well as willing to linkup other App owner to resolve my challenges. Well Done ED!
7	A+, great great great customer service! thanks to Matt for the help. We use your service for 3 sites and recommend it to others.
2	I'm begginig to use this app, the search engine is intuitive and easy, Its helping me with very complex products that have many variants.  Support has been very good.
5	Great work guys. Easy app to install and use. Great customer service as well for app questions. 10/10
7	Very nice app.  Good customer service.  Would recommend.  I asked for help and they gave it right away.
7	Great app, allows customers to easily find what they are looking for. Customer care  team was very helpful in our set up inquiries.
5	I recently completely changed my theme and inquired with Instant Search to update the code.  That same day they were done.  Thankfully it was an easy fix for them.  I've enjoyed the facet search capabilities that IS has to offer.  I've also been able to tailor and customize the search to look more like my website.  Ton of features and endless variants can be added with tags.  I also enjoy the analytics which helps me to refine and adjust words to make the searching easier for customers.  Redirect option when certain search words are entered is a wonderful feature as well.  As mentioned there are a ton of options and features too many to list.
10	I recommend this app, I searched a lot and finally got into this one. Great App, support and service.
5	Amazing app! After trying a few available at the Shopify App Store, I can say EasySearch is the best one. It provides multiple options to set up a YMM search which is very useful, specially for stores with a huge number of products. The support team has been very helpful! I definetly recommend it.
8	A strong team that is willing to take extra steps for customer satisfaction. Fast turn around time and efficient delivery. App works as advertised unlike most others.
5	This app did exactly what we wanted. It's easy to use and install. The designers are friendly, easy to contact and do any changes needed quickly. Recommended!
6	We have this app installed on our site, has very good functionality and works perfectly for our customers. Ilia was very helpful with some custom CSS to make it fit our website!
7	Stellar Service! I recommend this company highly. They were very responsive, helpful & went above and beyond. I am so happy for their support and the product looks GREAT! Thank you for helping me get the year, make, model search up and running. YOU ROCK!
5	The app is very practical for my store as it helps filters out different products in a very simple and appropriate way. Also, the customer service team is the best I have seen so far on Shopify!
2	This app sits above the fold of our homepage, and is the most used navigational feature of our store.  It is simple and reliable, easy to implement and manage.  We loved how lightweight and functional it is, and the develope provides amazing support, too.  Highly recommended, thank you!
5	"This app is really terrific! Exceptionally easy to to use and a really amazing support team. This is a great option for anyone that supplies parts or needs to ""drill down"" to get to the correct item. They have improved the search so you can find by a variety of data points. I'm not a CSS guy and I was having an issue integrating it into my site gracefully. I asked them if they could help and within 24 hours the search was beautifully installed on my site exactly as I wanted. Really great support. NexusMedia really is a top tier developer. We will be looking at their other apps to see how we can enhance the rest of the website."
2	So far, so good! Very happy with the look and feel of the EasySearch and the customer service has been AMAZING!
7	The Customer Support from this Team is simply amazing, they are very quick to arrive at a solution and are also very responsive to new ideas.
7	I used this App to help me get right size charts until i changed my Theme&needed things fixed .There has been no response in the last  4 Weeks despite me writing several  E-mails. What a pitty :(  I hope you reply to this  Review.I will give you one last chance to respond.
9	Testing out the free plan and we have had a really satisfying experience. Will surely recommend to all.
7	Team, I need you to please guide me in how I can use the sticky add and also use the calendar so people can choose the delivery time and timings slots. At the moment it goes directly to the cart > please try to guide us on this.
10	wow very good thanks  goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
3	I wish I could leave a good review because it looks like a nice app but unfortunately after I have installed it a few days ago I am still having an issue on mobile and iPad version... i tried to get in touch with support and as of today I still did not get any answer... now my 3 days trial is over and I guessed I will be charge for an app that simply did not work as expected... waste of money and waste of time...
10	This app is unique and fully meets our needs. Excellent support team.      Strongly recommend it.
10	I just started using the app. It is easy to implement and I look forward to the benefits of it on my store.
10	Working instantly, and very reactive support team. Congrats ;)
2	Actually really good! i was surprised to say the least, im a complete beginner but this app was simple and easy to use

7	Very helpful app! A lot of small but significant things were fixed on my website and improved its work. Thank you, team,  for your quick reply and support!
5	I needed an app to display a true size chart on my store and i think i've just found it.  High quality result, easy to edit, the customer service is always available if you need some help. Very efficient. Keep going like this ! :)
5	This app is really really helpful to create size charts for all our products. It is very easy to use and so convenient as well as it has conversions.
7	Exactly the functionality we were looking for with TREMENDOUS support - seriously, the developers are not only responsive but extremely friendly and helpful. Strongly recommend!
7	The worst apps! Whoever supposedly removes the brand logo, but since it's so slow to display, we can guess it anyway! After-sales service is really to shit when you have a problem. Stay away ...
10	Helped my website look better! it hiked guide consumers towards the professional side of my product. lllllllllllhboubvoawebljhcipweh pibpkcpwiec
4	amazing translator app. Very accurate for English to French. I am a social media strategist and I recommend it to all my clients

5	Excellent, speedy resolution provided to a seemingly trivial but potentially bounce-generating mobile display problem due to conflicting app.
7	Great app.  I had a bit of a learning curve but customer support helped guide me until I knew what I was doing.  Ultimate Size Chart is just what I was looking for.  Highly recommend.
5	Instant Brand Page app is a great app for me, the brand page was built instantly and support team is really awesome! i asked them to add favorite brands slider to homepage and they did it thank you so much

10	Great app worked great for our website www.talkingoutofturn.com

4	The apps works great, the customer support setup the language in header. Satisfied with the services and recommending you.
5	This app is a must have for my automotive supply business and has become the most used search feature on my website. Great customer service and support, Hitesh and the team are always quick to assist.
7	Thanks for your quick response and take care the setup. Very quick setup.  Recommended.
2	love the app, easy to use and easy to manupliate. Its is a must to have if you want to operate ur ecomm business well
10	"nice app. lets see how is works. I have just intalled it. If it works nice i will contunue using us for ever in my newly launched store - ""Homeboons"""
9	Easy to install and has a lot useful features such as a currency converter, animated buttons, etc. The best part is....this App is free. So, get it now.
7	Fantastic App! Would highly recommend. We switched over from another SEO app which we had used for years, it constantly had errors of late and we will never look back on making the change to JSON-LD for SEO. Setup was so Easy & Fast. The customer service has been outstanding and all of the errors we had in search console disappeared within days. Rich snippets were showing on our products within hours. Thank you so much :)
7	Worth it. Extremely helpful customer service. This app is your go-to station for sizes. GO FOR IT blindly!
5	Great app, I love the design and the features. The chat support is really fast and convenient. We need more apps like this !
5	The app is fantastic, creates an instant brand page which saves a huge amount of time if you have lots of vendors as we do. The support is second to none. Russel has helped very quickly with all of our requests and made some great suggestions and even helped with some css issues that were being caused by the store theme. Highly recommend this app.
7	it dont work at all im not sure why and how they have it set up but i paid for it and cant use it............................
9	It's easy to use. I'm glad that find this app. I think it's helped me to upgrade my shop. Now trying the free version, if I saw than I need more I'll buy it.
2	Questa app 猫 perfetta per le mie esigenze, facilissima da settare e da usare, semplicemente ottima. This app is perfect for my needs, very easy to set up and use, simply excellent.
4	one click translation of the whole website. Works perfect if you want a fast translation. Too god to be true!
10	Very quick to install and use, We had sent invitation for take care the setup. Thanks alot!
7	Great, works professionally and fast loading, customer service is very fast and great support, trustable, highly recommended.
4	Thank you very much! I had requested to reset the length of the timer and setup nicely. Now look good in desktop and mobile version.
7	I have install the app and send invite for staff account. Requested to change the timer position to look perfect.  Support is very responsive take care the setup. Thank You.
5	Great app and wonderful customer support. Helps you optimize your business with great analytics and inventory control not just from Shopify but also other marketplaces.
5	I use this app to provide a targeted alternative to finding products on my page. It uses the tag system so, as long as all products are tagged correctly, a robust series of look ups can be combined into a quick way to find a specific product. The support has always been amazing as well even for the free version, from customizations to integrations. Highly recommend.
2	We installed this app last week and so far we love it. We were after something customisable so that we could manually select the recommended products and this meets our requirements. Chris was exceptionally helpful and quick at making any tweaks we asked for. The only thing we would like to see on this app, is a 'back' button so that once you have edited a product, you can simply go back to the main app page instead of opening it again in a new tab. Love this app!
10	I haven't used the app yet but the demonstration was good. I' ll be back for a follow-up review once I have used it more. :-)
3	Grreeaat App! It works really well and doesn't affect speed negatively its very well performing.  Recomended because all the apps work properly
10	Eric is absolutely amazing. Truly 100% great support. Proactive and always with detail feedback. Keep the awesome job, Eric!
5	The service from Russel was magic, our drop downs were so big it was slowing down our site.  The brand page app solved the problem, whats more we needed to replace two drop downs in total, Russel made it possible for having 2 brand pages. The best service so far and had a lot of apps over 4 years of shopify. Another positive - when on a mobile the brand app couldn't be more clear. cheers Rainbowvapes
6	Super easy to use and the countdown app allows for customisation so I could change it to suit my website. Perfect.
5	DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! I have used the paid subscription and i completely regret that i have installed this buggy app. 1. After a while the FAQ stopped appearing on my product pages 2. Some product pages where DESTROYED by the app: images didnt show up, texts didnt show up, old product descriptions showed up  3. FAQ has a long loading time 4. Didnt find my products to automatically install the faq (after i tried to install the FAQs again after it messed up everything before) I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!
9	Removing the POWr branding from the free plan is the only downside for me. Otherwise it is a great app!
4	Thank you very much for your help! We have sent access and requested to setup the language widget in my store. Looks perfect in desktop and mobile.
5	A+ YMM App for Shopify Stores! The developer provides a great wealth of knowledge and design to their clients. Very willing to go that extra mile to create the best functional YMM product out there! Bravo HiTesh!
5	Amazing app with great functionality.  The customer support is one of the best I have ever dealt with when using a shopify app.  This is the app to go with if you need a find my car model feature. Many thanks
9	STILL CHARGING US!! Timer Panda - Countdown Timer (Uninstalled) $5.99 Timer Panda Countdown: 2019-01-17 - 2019-02-16 WHAT'S GOING ON??? THIS IS THE SECOND TIME!!
4	We are a high volume e-commerce company selling across many sales channels for 10 years now. During those years we have tried many different platforms and none of them really worked out for us, they all always did some things right and many things wrong.  Skubana was our last try before trying to build our own platform (which could be costly and come with a lot of headaches). Fortunately for us and kind of surprisingly, Skubana turned out to fill 99% of our needs. They have direct integrations with all the majors sales channels and other e-commerce tools/softwares and they also have indirect (via third party)  integrations with the rest of the lesser known tools and software one may need to run their ecom business. They priced out much better than the previous platforms we used in the past and they offer support via chat at all times on top of having your account manager to help you out. I am glad we gave Skubana a shot it helped us automate more of our business, saved us a considerable amount of $$ on payroll and overall just helped us grow our business over the last year plus we have been using them. I do not usually write reviews, but felt the need to do so in this case with the hope it will help others that find themselves in the same situation i was in.
8	The customer support during the set-up period is great and very helpful!  The app is good for looking at all levels of inventory across different locations. I like how you can customize your purchase orders as well as seeing order issues.
9	pretty useless to me  it did not ever work  honestly i think its better for paid options!! for free it hardly works
2	Thanks for your wonderful app. Worked like a charm. Very simple to use. Just a few clicks and Wola. Highly recommended.
10	Great SEO application !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very efficient and gives good results for my shop. Thanks
10	Super easy to use! An excellent app!! Super quick and responsive support. www.welcomeorganics.com.au.
6	Works great!  Easy to use! Brand page looks beautiful. Russel is the best. Helped me customized my page even during weekend.  Would recommend everyone to get this app.
6	Great app easy to use and great design the free version is not to much limited and will surely use it again.
2	Felicitari pentru aplicatie...suntem super multumiti! Acum putem incarca automat toate produsele direct in OLX printr-un singur click! Good job & MULTUMIM !!!
7	Very good customer service. Naana and Adbul were great and help me with my website reviews. Many thanks!
7	"I love this app. It's fairly simple to use and you can also add ""Universal Products"" that will show up with all of your vehicle-specific searches. I contacted Hitesh about integrating my current product results page with this app and they logged in and did it for me at no extra charge! A++ customer service, A++ product"
5	This is horrible app, it doesn't work properly at all and it is sloooow as hell. And design and functionality would be better done by 8 year old. It looks so cheap and bad. I would not recommend.
5	Great App! Especially their customer service. I installed the app but couldn't make it run on my store so they sent me an email to help me out. A few seconds later, they fixed it now I have pop-up cart upsells that attracts the attention of customers. I only wish that the app has more features.
5	We've been using Skubana for more than 2 years now. It was a game changer for us. It's great to have everything under one roof. Since we joined it looks like they've spent a great effort on fixing small bugs and now they're starting to add new features.  All in all I highly recommend this platform.
6	Very convenient APP!  We thought it only can do the way in default. But they actually can customize the layout. We love it.
5	Don't use it!!! Warming. It will change codes in your theme and make a mess! I spent 5 minutes to test it and another 2 hours to wipe up
4	A very great app! It was the only app that I could find that does reverse linking which will save you a ton of time if you need to link a large number of related products together. It is very intuitive to use and looks good in my theme. I haven't needed to contact support because everything worked after installation. My only suggestion for an upgrade is the ability to drag and drop the order of the products after they are linked. 5 Star and no complaints.
2	Fast to set up, super easy and straight-forward. Page speed leaves a little to be desired, but it does what it's supposed to do! https://www.dopeboo.com
6	The tech team provides amazing support, incredibly responsive. Goes above and beyond to set things up and make sure things work. The app did not fit our needs precisely (just because we wanted a very customized option, not at all possible with any app out there). That said, of all apps out there, this is the only one that even comes near to what we were looking for. A+
2	very nice app! easy to setup. nothing bad about it minimum 100 characters ..........................
9	the best free app on the market. thank you guys
2	"First of all, I will say that the app ""Uplinkly Language Translate"" has got proper design taste. Before downloading the app I checked and find it really cooler then any other apps from shopify store with the same feature. Secondly, the support. I'd rather provide a 10 start! The guy just mirror what I imagine for my website. Really really loved it."
7	I received assistance from Naana, he displayed patience especially since I was asking so many questions. He took his time and granted my request. Thank you!
5	I wish there was an option to give Hitesh and company 6 stars because these guys are awesome.  They go above and beyond for technical support and their response time is better than any of our other running apps.  On top of that, the YMM app works flawlessly.  Our store is now at a new level because of this app.  Thank you.
5	I really like this app very much. This is my best search ever I ever use. It provides the customer an easy way to find the product they want. Five stars.
7	Ok great, I used this app 2 stores. Thanks for fixing the placement issue..
2	"We decided to try this app in order to create some additional dynamics at the check-out, specially to set up the option ""gifts with purchase"". Unfortunately for that specific purpose, this will not be the best app as the gift is not removed from the cart if the product it is associated with is removed. If the app would add this feature that would be an amazing bonus and the app would cover many needs at the same time! However it works wonderfully to create discounted upsell offers, really recommend! The app is super intuitive, the staff is very accessible and always super available. Thank you!"
8	As Skubana's second customer I've certainly seen Skubana through many evolutions - and there's no doubt business has significantly improved because of it. This is a great program to grow with since it's built for expansion. The inventory tracking is airtight, and now that they've built a QBO connector, you have accounting natively integrated. Plus there are tons of integrations available so you can essentially plug and play. Excellent support team, having the chat function in the dashboard is super helpful.
8	Cannot praise this app enough. support is amazing, helpful and very fast when it comes to response. Shipping is rediculously quick and product quality has gained me 5 star reviews on trust pilot and 5 star reviews on etsy. Try them once and you wont regret it.
7	Great app for adding matching items together for the customer to see pair items when viewing a product. Very easy to setup and you can link products together from the product page in Shopify admin. When using other similar apps I have had to go into each product to link them together but with this app you only have to link up the one product. The only complaint I have is that when I contacted customer support they were not extremely helpful. Instead of really trying to get to the bottom of what I was asking, or offer to assist me, they just emailed me the instructions to do it myself, but other than that I have no complaints.
5	All the apps from this developer is really really amazing apps! I have installed all the apps of this developer and really happy. Highly recommend for every one.
5	This is a great app. I installed it a little over a week ago and my rich results are already appearing in Google images. Eric has also been very helpful and constantly sends updates and tips. I definitely recommend this for every store.
7	Great, easy to use app! Support is excellent, Russel responds fast & fixes things very quickly. Same experience like with their other apps, the team is great to work with. App is definitely worth the money!
6	I highly appreciate the quick and solid support given. Imagine they find ways to customize the app just for my request. And it's all free! Awesome support!
4	"I'm using the app for a couple of weeks and I'm absolutely satisfied. My shop is originally set up in French. The English translation is correct. I needed a word changing ""Sold out"" to replace ""Out of print""...Mickael did a fast job. I do recommend the app. Easy to add and great customer service"
5	"I鈥檝e been using Kudobuzz for over 2 years and it鈥檚 been a great experience from the beginning. The customer support has ALWAYS been excellent. They always answer questions quickly, resolve issues quickly and even did some specific code changes for me. All of this has been on the FREE plan! I am still on the free plan, as it supports publishing up to 50 reviews and I鈥檓 not there yet. I鈥檓 surprised that the free plan offers so much functionality! I鈥檓 able to customize things and the various widgets are available for me to use (e.g., widget to show a slide of all reviews, widget to show a ""trust seal鈥?reviews badge, widget to display a full page of my reviews...and more).  I LOVE that I can collect site level reviews along with product reviews. That is a must-have feature I require, as so much of my jewelry is unique/one-off so the product page goes away when I can鈥檛 make that product any longer. I wouldn鈥檛 want to then lose any product reviews that were left for a product I don鈥檛 make/sell any more. Not only can the customer decide to leave a site-level vs product review - on the manage reviews dashboard I can convert a product review to a site review!!! Perfect!!  I also love that I can manually input reviews. E.g., I sell my jewelry on Amazon Handmade and get reviews there. If I was on the first level paid plan, I would be able to sync and collect my reviews from Amazon, but on the free plan I can鈥檛. So, for now, I鈥檓 entering my Amazon reviews manually to Kudobuzz. I鈥檓 just happy there is a way to do this.  In addition, I also really love that I can set Kudobuzz up to auto-publish any review over x # of stars - that鈥檚 a time saver. And, even on the free plan, I have it set up to send emails requesting reviews. Seriously, there are a lot of features available for free.  Of course, I do want the additional functionality that is offered with the paid plans, so I will need to upgrade at some point.  One feature I REALLY wish was in the first level upgrade plan (鈥淏reakfast plan鈥? currently priced at $13/month) is the ability to offer a discount coupon code to entice someone to leave a review. It looks like that is only available once you upgrade to the 鈥淟unch plan鈥?at $20/month plan. Considering the $13/month plan supports up to 1000 reviews, I think it should include the 鈥渃oupon code鈥?feature at that level of plan. Coupon codes are one of the ways to generate more reviews, so why is it only available at the 3rd level plan for $20/month? If I already had over 1000 reviews, I wouldn鈥檛 need the coupon code feature so badly!  The other VERY important functionality for all reviews is to have Google rich snippet reviews. For Kudobuzz, they say that is 鈥渃oming soon鈥?- unfortunately, it鈥檚 slated to be in the $20/month plan. I hope they add this functionality soon, and I REALLY hope they include it in the $13/month plan instead. It鈥檚 just SO important. For example, Stamped.io supports rich snippets on their free plan, and Yotpo also supports rich snippets (although I鈥檓 not sure if with their free plan). So, it鈥檚 truly a negative that Kudobuzz does not yet support rich snippets at all. Of course, the other two apps I mentioned have different features offered with their various free and paid plans, so there are tradeoffs you need to make when deciding which features are the most important to you so you can choose which app will provide you the best bang for your buck (or for free!). For me at this point, Kudobuzz gives me what I must have right now. Hopefully, they will support other functionality I will be needing when I am ready to upgrade to a paid plan. Given all that, for my needs right now, this is a 5 star app. For my upcoming needs, the lack of availability of coupons and Google rich snippets would make this a 4 star app for me in the future.  Hope this info helps someone!  c~"
7	Purchased this app for an auto website and ran into a few questions. Contacted support and they were amazingly informative and helped us achieve what we wanted with the app! Thanks!!!!
5	Extremely happy with this app so far. Easy to add and remove products once you get going. Customer service has been exceptional.
5	I have install the App and send invite for staff account. Support is very responsive and setup the timer app and set the position to look professional.
8	Works great. Keeps track of my inventory fast and easy. Also updates customer orders quickly and easily with tracking. Customer support is fast. Great software.
7	We use Skubana for the fulfillment of our store's orders. Skubana Support is always helpful in helping us resolve issues with shipping services or inputting customs information for international orders. They provide prompt, courteous, and friendly service, and make an honest effort to resolve all issues. Shout out to Sandi at Skubana! She's helped us out on several issues with orders related to customs and shipping information. We appreciate her help so much. She always follows up and makes sure that all issues have been satisfactorily resolved. Thanks so much for great, consistent customer service, Sandi and Skubana Support team!!!
4	This app is very incredible. Chat support is very helpful. I hope your company continued to add other products and add special support such as Facebook Group. I will build a new store with this app, you must try and I give 100% recommend these guys.
7	I can't praise these guys enough! The team at SuperFast POD are amazing! The delivery time is super fast. They answer every question quickly. I researched POD companies, and although this one doesn't have a lot of reviews (Maybe because they don't hound you inside the app to leave a review) There were no complaints at all. And I'm so glad I chose them. If I could give them more then 5 stars, I would. They are based in the U.K. but ship worldwide. You won't be sorry you chose them. 100% review from me. Thank you for all your help :)
7	Great app, thank you! I was looking around but couldn't find anything suitable until I found this app! User friendly and serves its purpose well!
3	Product would not install on website. Throws an error on the installation process.
9	Really amazing app to promote my products with discount codes for this christmas season. Highly recommended. 5+
7	A blank rectangular appears on the place where the popup is supposed to be.  I contacted the support team two times and they promised to fix it in 48 hours both of the times. It's been one month since my last complaint and nothing is fixed but they still charge me for their broken services. I strongly recommend them to be honest with their clients and if they cannot fix the issues just to tell us and stop charging us for something that makes our shop look unprofessional and unreliable.
7	It creates a nice brand page in seconds and is mobile friendly. Super service from the team and very quick response. Help me to style the brand page, so it match my theme. Save me a lot of time! Thanks a lot to Russel.
5	This app can solve our hot sale sorting problem well. He can update himself. And the customer service reply quickly! Good application
2	I have been looking for a similar app for a while. I am happy to find this one. it works well and easy to install. I recommend it
4	I use this app to translate in several language my store. To set up this app, I wished to have a fixed box language/flag in the header and Michael did it quickly and perfectly:  The customer service is exceptional. The translation in French is almost perfect and this app is free !!!!
7	I had trouble importing my reviews from Etsy to Shopify, so I was happy with their customer service. They were fast and helpful.
5	I'm sure it works great if you have less than 10 products.  You'll have to search per product to do a forecast...
6	The app works great and I was able to get help customizing it within 2hrs.  I highly recommend this app!
8	the best timer app ever, very responsive to mobile, eye-catching, the team is amazing, alaways there to resolve problems, this is how it has to be the work for all the other apps
7	First of all let me say the app works very well and I love it. I had a change in them and had a problem integrating the pop up feature myself, I contacted the developers and they were very quick and efficient and resolved the problem in just a couple of hours. Amit was amazing very patient and offered to help with other issue with my store. Highly recommend!
8	It has been great!  Skubana is an important part of our business and has allowed us to manage our inventory as we have grown to thousands of SKUs They have been willing to listen to us as we both grow together.  They are always open to new ideas and changes that help us. It has been important for us and now is not an issue we have in our company that will limit our growth.
4	This app is awesome! There is a huge variety of products. There are two problems I have with this app.  1) They have specific dimensions that must be followed to a T when uploading images and only allow Jpgs as the supported image type. Other POD systems allow you to upload PNGS, PSD or even EPS and allow you to scale the image how you see fit.  2) This one is more insignificant then the other. However, I am in the states I dont want to have to convert prices for the products and shipping on my own. You should look into adding a currency converter so people can know without google what a product will charge in their currency.  When those two issues are fixed let me know and I will 100% use this POD system.
7	I found Supefast POD by accident and what a find i have made. I Installed the app and uploaded my designs. TOP customer service - Paul helped me by explaining the importance of the DPI and the placement of one of my designs which enhanced the quality of the image on the product and all which was greatly appreciated by myself as a non tech/design guy. Superfast printed, shipped t shirts and phone cases which where received by my customers in a  superfast 7/8 days. I can confirm the shirts and phone cases are of the highest quality with customer service to match.  We are now in the process of using Superfast as our preferred supplier by adding more of their products to our range.  We highly recommend Superfast POD.  John
7	App works well. Super fast support. I wrote them for 2 different support issue. They solved in couple minutes. Recommended!
10	I tried a lot of apps before and this one is the best. Really great app! Easy to use and works well. Recommend!
2	This is an absolutely great app. It easily lets you add related products to your Shopify store in various ways. It is very easy to use and understand. And, when compared to similar apps it is very affordable. I have always thought that showing related products is a feature that should be built in to Shopify themes. This app offers a good solution. Highly Recommended!
5	Super support from Eric.  Worked quickly.  Installed on June 12th, Rich Results were showing June 25th.  Foundational SEO made easy.  Do it!
5	This has been the best value and most worthwhile purchase for my store. Not only do you get the rich snippets, Eric also sends the most informative emails on how to get the most out of your seo work.  I was concerned about the huge amount upfront but would pay double now i know how valuable it is to the success on my store.
2	Easy and simply to use... does what it says on the box. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a best seller ad on
4	Thanks, the app looks interesting, we installed it because we thought that Bestseller personalisation per country is a great idea, it brings in a personal touch as of what customer prefer to buy, can't wait to try it out!
4	So good to finally find an app that can be used for Facebook, Google, Pinterest and more! The automatic feed generation saves us so much time and the ability to custom map fields is awesome. I had a question and the support team responded to me within 30 minutes. We use the app on multiple stores and are extremely happy! Thanks team.
7	With Kudobuzz I was able to import all of my Etsy reviews into Shopify. From there I had excellent app support from David who responded immediately to my questions regarding installing the widget onto my product pages. It's great to have such quick support for a very helpful app. For a long time I've been hoping to find an app that could bring Etsy reviews into Shopify, and Kudobuzz did it! Thank you for your app and great support!
7	Great app and fast customer service! Installation of the widgets was a bit hard for me but I was helped very good and fast by customer service.
5	Looks like a GREAT app.  The features are unique and I haven't found them on any other app. But, there is a bug and it won't let me enable/save.  I have contacted support but am not getting a response.
2	Amazing app, very nice and simple! great stuff guys.
7	Made an immediate impact on the average purchase price on our store, and it is a great tool to use for special deals / offers. Their support staff is fantastic. We had a minor issue with the integration for our theme, and it was sorted out by Kemi (a member of their team) in just a few minutes. Definitely recommend.
8	We utilize Skubana for order routing and inventory management.  It's a fantastic platform that has helped us leverage multiple additional technologies.  Highly recommend.
8	So far I've ordered a wallet case from here and the quality is very good. The printing quality, small details and the case have a premium feel to them  My design was black and white, the front of the case itself is printed on a white surface with color layed on top of it. If you're going for black, choose #000 as a shade of dark-gray might have a tint of green to them, which is normal for stuff like this. The case closes very firmly with a magnet and the feel of the faux leather is very great and comfortable! The customer support is also very fast and helpful, the delivery time was very fast - I think the product arrived in less than a week, but my local post office forgot to notify me so after a week I went to check and the item was already there Definitely suggest using their wallet cases as they feel premium, you can price them higher than others!
7	Very professional and reliable service. If you are looking for a POD company then I would 100% recommend these guys.
7	The customer service has been amazing. The team was able to work with us throughout all the setup of the app, and were very helpful clarifying how the app works, and how to make everything work the way we needed it to. A responsive team is worth a lot when working on something like this. Looking forward to see what's next.
5	This is a must-have for all Shopify stores. We installed JON-LD for SEO more than 6 months ago to help resolve flakiness with Google Shopping. After about 40 days all of the errors were gone (except the ones we introduced ourselves) and our feed was working with no issue. And then new revenue started to appear - both an increase in organic and paid traffic which both yielded sales. Any questions we had along the way were quickly answered by Eric.
2	It is easy to install and very clear instructions.  You just  need to keep  in mu\ind  that  you  need to   have  at  least   15  sales  per  a  chosen  period  to create the collection.
7	App works great. First had some trouble, but that was because of the used cookie blocker app. Michael from Customer Support pointed me towards it quickly. TLDR: Great App and awesome Customer Support! =)
4	Honeslty?!! its is very good, easy to use, and understandable in the languages I selected, the fact that you have 10 languages for the free account is great. Thank you so much, I am a beginner and this has helped me alot
4	So good to finally find an app that can be used for Facebook, Google, Pinterest and more! The automatic feed generation saves us so much time and the ability to custom map fields is awesome. I had a question and the support team responded to me within 30 minutes. We use the app on multiple stores and are extremely happy! Thanks team.
5	I love the app. Exported all reviews from other marketplace shop. Also, there is an option to convert reviews to product reviews. Excellent customer service!
5	I've been using this app for months now. The amount of times that I've needed to contact support is outrageous. I am not the one to ever leave reviews, but I highly recommend avoiding this app. I am now having to link every single review to my products AGAIN because they got unlinked somehow. 1 by 1, an incredibly slow process. This is one of MANY issues with this is - duplicate reviews, weak support team, etc.
5	This app has got so many bugs. Changing options or refreshing the browser deactivates the discount.
7	Not recommending the app to anyone. Contacted support about 3 weeks ago and the issue inside the app still isn't fixed.
9	This app does the job for Discounted Upsell & Cross Sell. Just double checked and it works on mobile and desktop.. customer support is great on and fast!
2	I don't know where we would be without Skubana. When all other platforms failed to meet our needs or were too robust, Skubana saved the day. They provide a UI that's easy for our team to navigate, and their automation is seamless. Our on-boarding process was clear, and they let us move at the pace best fit for our team. I would highly recommend Skubana for any e-commerce brand, even custom ones with an array of SKUs. Skubana helped our highly customizable jewelry brand to track every single core product via bundles & kits, and the ROI is incomparable. Highly recommended.
8	A new jewel has emerged in the POD world. Top quality products - they look like luxury brand items. Shockingly fast delivery from the UK to the US. Responsive and friendly support. So excited to continue to build out my store with their products.
8	Superfast POD is called that name for a reason...I've used them a couple of time for most of my orders both within the UK and international shipping, and the speed at which they produce and deliver products to my customers is top-notch. The quality of their products are super high, and customer service is the holy grail of their brand, as its super responsive and always available to help merchants. If you're having second doubts about using them, I suggest you have this app integrated on your store if super fast delivery is an option you want for your store.
2	Good app for free, customer service responds in lightning speed, however app does not place lookup form on collection pages, its more suited as an extra menu item & page. It works & looks nice on on page, I had trouble with getting it to find products but it works great when set to all & searching min or max price. If you want to add it to collection pages that is considered a custom feature & will cost $70 for 2 hours of coding. Tie - Fly Clothing www.tieflyclothing.com
7	Awesome! Helpful service too. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4	The support of this team is really great. They helped us quickly identify the problem. In fact, we are not familiar with certain settings in this regard. The application is really great, we tried at least 5, 6 highly rated applications. Their support for our templates is the best, and the UI display is compatible with wap usage. This team is very responsible~, we used it to run very well
4	Worked straight away and 10 free launguages is more than enough for me. Great app dont hesitate to download
7	Installed the app, had some trouble uploading my feed and customer support was amazing, they got back to me super fast and resolved my issue and corrected my feed. Thank you for your help!
5	Works well and they helped us set up our feed for which we were very grateful. It needs some time get used to if you have never worked with feeds before, because the app has A LOT of functionality. Support is happy to help you out if you have any questions regarding customizations of your feed. We can recommend the app very much!
2	I really like this app and what it has enabled me to do. Putting my reviews up on product pages with the star rating next to the product title too (with a little theme editing). It does however have one major drawback. To publish reviews to product pages you have to manually type the exact product title. When you have over 400 products this is a massive time consuming process. Please please introduce a drop down menu where you can select products or a search function.  Conclusion- - great app, does what it says it does - way too clunky, needs streamlining - I would 100% recommend this app to shops with fewer products
9	No point in buying this app. The discounted price is only displayed on product page and not on checkout page. What's the whole point of showing discount if it can't be applied at the time of checkout. In fact this will frustrate the customers and will drive them away as they will not trust us.
7	Updating my review from 1  to 5  as these guys proactively fixed the shortcomings of the app and also reached out to me for a feedback again. Really happy that the app is working as it should and can really help boost the sales in a big way
10	This app is wonderful! It helps my store to have the ability to do cross-sell and up-sells to increase conversion value from the same customers effectively. I highly recommend it.
7	excellent app the only one i use and the help from customer support is second to none. thanks from www.manicmadeinmanchester.co.uk
2	excellent easy and fast application, very simple to understand, very fast and professional assistance, I recommend everyone to download it
4	The quality of this app translation is great, working fast and easy to install. The  popup banner is nice design. Should have one in your store.
4	Hands down the best product feed for Facebook and Google Merchant Centre. Excellent support. 10/10 would highly recommend.
7	I actually found it easy to use but I needed some extra help and support got back to me right and went over and above to solve my problem. I really can't thank them enough. This app had already saved me time and made my work day much easier:)
7	Amazing app! We saw improvements in less than a single day. I would recommend it any day! Follow the simple instructions and you are good to go.
7	The in cart up sell is working very well, the settings are very precise on which items to up sell when certain product has been added to cart. It is pretty handy and most importantly it is free. Faced some issue on 1st try, but the service team has the best attitude and solved it within an hour. highly highly recommended!
7	Amazing customer service! We had issues with syncing our feed to Pinterest and they were extremely prompt and attentive when helping us fix the issue. They resolved it quickly and made it simple for us.
2	Not what I expected.  Clunky to use.  Difficult for a regular joe to understand.  Ended up deleting and going back to my old app. The support for the app was incredible but I don鈥檛 have the patience to not be able to do things on my own......or learn new methods to do something I know how to do in my old app.
7	I'm new to all of this and the support is fantastic, very knowledgable and definitely very helpful. I now have successfully setup products in my merchant center and I'm up and running thanks to this. I tried another app but I couldn't get it to work.
4	I really recommend this app. It helped us to migrate 200 blogs from WordPress to Shopify. With this app we can still use WordPress to manage and build our blogs and have them on our main shop domain. Thank you!
5	A really simple transaction with no input required. Rich snippets appeared on my products within a week! I loved the free SEO content that they sent me later which has helped to kickstart the SEO for my store at www.membuilding.com. Eric really knows his stuff.
4	I use this app to help me to get my articles from wordpress to shopify. I really like how fast and easy it is to do so.  5/5
5	Eric has been outstanding.  We have been seeing growth in our search traffic as well as having items come up as products in image search.   Beyond the above, he has been a big help both before and after I purchased the app integration with SEO questions that are well beyond the basics.
5	I was looking for a very specific function so I installed this app to check it out and it does indeed seem straightforward and easy. Support was very helpful and responsive and saved me a lot of time.
8	Ho installato e iniziato ad utilizzare in 10 minuti.  Spiegazione con video perfetta e chiara. Utilizzo fatture in cloud e la fattura dell'ordine 猫 stata passata da shopify a fattureincloud dopo pochi minuti, con numerazione progressiva o personalizzata, rifermento al n. di ordine e prodotti venduti. La fattura creata, non viene inviata al sdi in modo da poterne verificare manualmente la correttezza e/o apportare piccole modifiche.  Applicazione PERFETTA. Complimenti
6	I switched to SKUBANA a couple of months back and their support team was really helpful throughout the transition process. Great app, Great Features, and really neat and clean compared to others that are out there. More adaptive to customizations and be able to reverse certain features would be a great help! Overall, It's a great software.
7	The app works very well after some adjustments that we made on our website following Eric's guidelines. Eric, the manager of the app, is very reactive, nice and helpful to set up the app. He also gave me some additional advice regarding the SEO and rich snippets of my website. I am very satisfied and i really recommend this app !
4	Very easy to use. Clear instructions. We do a lot of influencer marketing so having a product feed submitted to Google GREATLY boosted the engagement with our organic brand searches and led directly sales. HIGHLY recommended even if you don't end up using for Google Shopping Ads.
8	This has been a useful app in managing our inventory an the support is fantastic! I wish ETD was an option but they are working on this feature request and will hopefully have it up and running soon.
7	Our epic journey to find an inventory management system for Boldify lasted about 14 painful months. Most of our sales are from FBA and our workflow is relatively simple.  Amazingly, after trying Orderhive, Tradegecko, and Unleashed, none of these companies were able to meet our needs, from both a software and customer service standpoint.  Fourteen months later and tens of thousands of dollars lost due to stock-outs, time wasted, and software fees, we finally found a solution with Skubana. The way their system is organized follows better logic than the others and is highly customizable and automatable.  Skubana is powerful enough to support our growth all the way to enterprise level and we couldn't be happier. All that said, the best thing about Skubana was their customer service.  Most of the reason this journey has taken us 14 months is due to slow and tedious onboarding and support from the other companies.  Alex from Skubana was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful, and it has made all the difference in the world for us. We can't recommend Skubana highly enough and wish we had of chosen them fourteen months ago!
5	I've only had the app for a short time so it's a bit early to see SEO results. However, Eric has been great about sending SEO tips, letting me know when my rich snippets are available and even let me know my products are showing up with images as well. I'll review again in three months and six months after the app has had more time to build SEO.
7	I needed help with products that didn't show up on our feed and I got answers very quick, and my problem was solved quickly as well. Great customer service!
8	I have been an e-commerce seller since the dark days of the Internet in 1997.  Over the past 20+ years I have used many different platforms - often combining features for different companies to get the systems that we need.   We were seeking a web based platform that assist with our inventory / COGS / multiple platforms / forecasting and order processing.  We looked at a number of solutions including TradeGecko / Fishbowl / Orderlo and others.  Skubana was the one that ticked all the boxes.  It actually replaced a number of other platforms and saves us time and resources each month. There is a learning curve when using Skubana but once you get to know the system it can become very powerful.    The support is the best I have received from any software company - you can see they really do care about their customers and do what they can to make sure things are working as needed. I would have no hesitation in recommending Skubana and have already done so many times.
8	Overall, this program came to us at the perfect time. We went from inventory that was manageable manually, to inventory that just needed some sort of software to help us mange this. Ive been live for a couple days now and it seems like everything is going great. They have orderbots that implement automatic rules you make for your inventory and shipping. Every time ive had an issue, it was resolved in a matter of minutes. The customer support team at Skubana is on it and they know how to keep a customer happy.
5	I would give this 10 stars if I could. Eric's support is swift and extremely easy to follow. He actually took the time to tell me about some mistakes I had made that would have a negative impact on my google SEO. This app put me at the top of search results quickly. Easily the best money I have ever spent on any app.
7	So far I have nothing but good things to say about Skubana. I heard about them on a podcast and mentioned them to my employee that was researching inventory management software options.  After looking at many other options (many of which were cheaper) we saw that you really do get what you pay for and that we wanted to do it right if we were going to do it at all.   We just launched after maybe 15 calls with Jeffrey Na, our account manager.  His customer service, knowledge, and attention to detail are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen.  I'd love to buy him a drink if I'm ever in town as he has been and I know will continue to be an excellent resource for us as we grow.  Just getting started but the future is looking bright!
8	Great little app that makes my life a lot easier. We sell cooked meals that customers can have delivered or pickup from our shop. Because our team need to be able to schedule production of orders based on type, delivery runs, and order times I need to be able to extract my order info from Shopify into a sheet where I can manipulate the info to give me production schedules and delivery route run downs. The G Sheets app pulls this info cleanly into an easy to use format that lets me build around the imported info. The auto-update feature is a fantastic recent addition that keeps my info current without breaking any links or formulas in the sheets. But the best part has been over the last week when I added in the new shopify feature, local pickup, and needed an extra field to separate delivery orders from pickups. I sent the team a message, Olivier got back to me promptly and worked with me to find a solution and update the app to get me the info I needed. Great app with great support.
8	Impressive piece of software for helping manage inventory data. We use it extensively to help predict demand and issue the correct quantities when ordering inventory. This has really helped reduce/eliminate stockouts (thus paying for itself) without having to find yourself yelling at excel. Also, great for calculating COGS from multiple sales channels, and using multiple channels to make sales and linking those sales to a single fulfilment network.  If you are spending hours trying to predict inventory levels... forecast inventory needs..etc inside excel I would give Skubana a call!
8	Thank you Skubana for all you help and support! I haven't been using this system very long but I know it will help our growing company more than we know. It's the best way to track on inventory across multiple sales channels. I look forward to implementing all the features Skubana has to offer to help manage our products. The reps are awesome! Thank you Wali and Jeffrey for all your help!
7	It has been incredibly helpful for our operations! Olivier and his team are extremely responsive and accomodating. There are some minor glitches, otherwise, the team is super supportive. Can't recommend it enough!!!
9	Tech support is absolutely amazing! Everything I need this app to do was carefully thought out and a solution or formula was devised to make sure I was getting everything I needed. The price tag is a little steep for a monthly fee for an app, but these guys definitely work for their money! 鉂わ笍鉂わ笍鉂わ笍
4	My Art Concierge is ahead of the game with this app. We downloaded it to allow customers to commission paintings of themselves as Presidents and Politicians. Had a bit of issue getting the shipping to work however the app team was quick to answer and helped us instal smoothly. We commissioned a painting as an example and it looks great. Next step, market our new product line on facebook and instagram!
9	Amazing app with great and unique features. The app is really fast and one of the best you can get + it's free !!!
5	After setting up my Shopify store without using a developer, it felt like I could do anything! Until I started reading about Schema mark up, Rich Snippets, Rich Results, etc... Typically when reading blogs and watching YouTube videos on the subjects, it will give me clarification. But in this case... I was lost, and became more lost. Knowing however how important it is for SEO, I went searching for an App. The price of the JSON LD for SEO App is definitely a little steep, but well worth it if you just want something to work automatically, and have it work well.  Google changes things on a monthly basis it seems like, so to have Eric the App developer watch out for that, and adjust things when they need it, is another reason why the App is well worth the one time fee.  In my store's case it took a couple of months for the rich result and snippets to show up, but that was all up to Google. Eric had already warned me for that, sometimes it takes a week and sometimes up to 3 months, which is out of his control. But now all working, it's already made a big difference.  On top of all that, Eric's support has been tremendous. He sends out Newsletters on a daily basis with great info, and encourages anybody to ask questions about anything that's store- and its success related. Eric knows a lot, so besides all the Json Ld stuff, he's provided me with great knowledge and advice, and sends his replies the same or next day!  Can't beat the App and the Support!    Anna S.

9	"There are tools that I hope I never have to work with. Fortunately, Skubana isn't one of them. I was completely new to logistics when I first used it 5 months ago and didn't know what I was doing, but I found my way around rather quickly. Here's what I like in particular * Great customer support with short response time * Feels stable * Mostly intuitive * Feature-Rich * Short loading times * Rather modern UI Another good thing is the Marketplace, especially that it allows you to write your own app for it. The biggest downside is its high price. Of all services and software we use, it is the most expensive one but maybe that's just because the price is (probably) calculated based on the number of orders and revenue - both of which don't say whether or not your company is making a lot of money ;-) Other than that, there are not many cons I'm aware of. The UI could use some small improvements here and there (filterable tables, ambiguous use of the word ""Export"", fields that look editable but aren't) but those are really just minor issues. Using Skubana for years - perfect!"
7	Very useful app, friendly and really free. Working very well and the developer answer to your question quickly.
4	This app is perfect for knowing if my store's ad campaigns are working or not. I like the fact that it tells me what orders came from each campaign link.
4	This app shows the USD price in BTC and is an excellent concept and very useful to us and our customers.
5	This is by far, the BEST app for SEO, Rich Snippets, Traffic, oh and if you need support....the best customer service and support to match the quality of this app! This app has had a Huge Impact on our Google Presence and should not be overlooked. Give this app a try and let it work it's magic.....We did and we couldn't be Happier!!
5	His email list alone is worth the price. No clue if the app is actually helping but I'm assuming so!
8	We are using Skubana more than a half of a year and Skubana is a great platform to use. The connections and navigation are easy and logical which makes it really efficient to track inventory and orders from all our Sales Channels. (Amazon, Shopify, Walmart, eBay). It supports our 3PL Warehouses via FTP and API connection. The interface is really friendly to users. You do not need any special skills to operate in Skubana. One more important thing is that Skubana is a rather speedy app. Import/export information takes seconds.  Special thanks to the support team that is always there ready to provide with prompt, helpful and qualified response to pretty much any issue.
5	Bad app, Never getting updates of orders on G sheet, Waste of time i tried to sync more than 10-20 time got waste 15-20 Mins
7	I am here re-reviewing this app because the programmer of this app was quick to correct and respond to the problems i had with it. I am satisfied with the care he put into this. I would recommend this app. it may have some things to be worked out but i assure you that if you state any problems it may have, they will quickly be looked into and worked on.
4	Great app, great support. We use this for our social media bio links and it has become super easy to attribute sales to various social media platforms.
4	I recommend this app to anyone doing any sort of marketing where the link is going to visible, it makes it super easy to shorten the link and track all necessary analytics in one spot. Especially if you're running multiple campaigns at once, this is mandatory. 10/10 app right here.
4	Messed up all my fulfilments by sending customers a tracking link that goes to some random site, not the tracking company I put in the spreadsheet. Now all my customers have a useless tracking link in their inboxes.
7	I'm so pissed of right now on the customer service!!!! It's been a few days I'm trying to contact them but either no response or I get an answer that I don't need. I was trying to install the app for our website but I guess I will never get the chance to install it because of the apps installation problem! Could never been worse!!!!
4	Best app for importing products from lot of platforms it's really great, Thank you so much!
2	LinkTrack has made working with influencers and measuring results extremely simple for our business. The app has a clean intuitive design and allows us to create campaigns in seconds. I also had a quick question and support got back to us in 30 minutes. Recommended!
2	Great app. Super easy to create shortened urls for our product pages and track all sales from that link. UI is great and not overly complex with unnecessary data. Just what's needed.
8	I can't believe I just found out about this app. Save yourself the pain of manually fulfilling CSV orders and get this app ASAP.
5	Perfect for the job. We started to use is for fulfilling our orders of CBD products on uWeed and it is very simple to use. Fulfilling 1 or 100 orders takes pretty much the same effort and the app is saving us some precious time in our operations.
8	Works good and is easy to use.  Only two issues that we identified: 1) There is no spot for PICKUP notes (critical during Coronavirus so we can tell the Postmates driver how and where to pickup at our very large building). 2) The delivery locations appear to sync once with Shopify Settings and never again...so if you update an address, the app won't ever know it.
10	Great app - I really won my time :) keep going guys - you made something really crazy.
4	Very useful app. We constantly run influencer campaigns and use this app to generate the links we give to the influencers. Now we can attribute orders and revenue to certain influencers and make more informed decisions going forward. Support team is also super helpful and responsive.
10	Did exactly what needed. Very useful App. saves a lot of time and effort. I highly recommend it>>>>
2	Best app ever made, saves tons of time and makes fulfilling easy! Simple and intuitive UX. Great work!
7	The app works well and Abhishek is very responsive. I asked him to customize the email for me and he did it within the day. Thanks!
10	We've just recently installed the app.  It did take about a day for it to start appearing as a shipping option but seems to be working fine now.
7	The app worked for a while but eventually started erroring out whenever I'd try to setup a delivery.  Postmates customer service was extremely poor.  They wouldn't follow up after their original email response and could never come up with a solution.  Their poor technology and customer service will make it very easy for their competition to swallow them up.  I look forward to working with better companies with much better technology to handle my company's same-day delivery needs.
7	Does what it is supposed to, easy interface and responsive support team. Happy with the app, recommend to any OPs/ecomm manager.
5	I used this app to help create daily order reports. What impressed me most was the developers response time. Extremely helpful. Really like the fact that reports are incremental, so when you automate a report it never doubles up on info.
10	Excellent application. I love the last update. I give five stars for this app. thank you Adpsiar.
4	Time saver! We're awaiting the delivery of a piece of software that pulls the tracking info from our stock system into Shopify. In the mean time this app has probably saved me half an hour a day for the last 4 months. Great work!
8	This app is a real lifesaver. if you're using an agent to fulfill you orders then uploading tracking in bulk with this app takes only few minutes.
10	Before I even downloaded the APP Abhishek and his team worked on exactly what we needed! Highly recommended!
6	Really great app that helped me create customized notifications to my suppliers. And the customer support was fast and great
8	Perfect app! We use it since 3 month and the feature for scheduled exports and export to Cloud are perfect for automatic fulfillment by our supplier. Great work!
4	We use this app to export our orders from shopify to import into our business's accounting system. The format was easy to setup and although we had an issue at the beginning, Andreas was able to provide a solution - it was something we were missing - and got us up and running quickly. Great app and free if you aren't exporting tons of data at a time! Exactly what we need.
4	perfect application for all level dropshipping traders , i strongly advise to everyone...thanks Poky
10	This app is really helpful and easy to use. It saves lots of time for us. I'd like to recommend it to all. Thank you so much!
8	The app works great. Our suppliers get an email with the order whenever a payment is captured, and with the added logic we can choose which supplier gets which order.  Support is great as well, fast and dedicated.  Thank you!
7	Great App, Perfect customer service. When I installed the app they were running maintenance of the server. I had issues. It took them 10 minutes to answer me back and help me installed the warning note to my website themselves. Great fast response, good customer service too.
7	Well, although simple, the app solved a real problem for me. I also needed a tweak to the app and the developer fixed this within no time. Excellent service!
4	I used the app to export custom excel files for my business. It鈥檚 very easy to use and helpful. The best part is the customer support which is why I rated 5/5 stars! Solved all my problems with a quick response. Recommended !
9	Fantastic app, It is a lot cheaper than Duplicate app if you're on a budget and you and want to import products from your competitors then this is the best option :) . First app I ever recommended :)
8	Great and simple to use. It makes fulfilling orders and automatically sending tracking numbers a breeze.
5	The best and simplest application, very efficient processing of orders, great application, thanks for the free service
10	Outstanding support. They are super hero. Thank You very much for all. App is very very useful. Every store should be have this app.
8	Unsurpassed support!!! I have their other app installed - Unfulfilled Order Notifier - and this one. Same developer has not only responded immediately to ALL my questions, but went well above & beyond to build out the app to my needs. Per my request - This app now includes Low Stock Notifications! This guy is brilliant. Fast. And extremely polite. 5 Stars is not enough to give!
7	Directions were not clear, but the help desk assistant was great!
8	Amazing and helpful app. Reduces customer support emails from customers by notifying them automatically about e.g. delays.
6	Me gusta, es muy practica y 煤til. ademas te permite alguna flexibilidad y configuraci贸n de formatos.
8	This app is the one of easiest & fastest apps for Exporting orders via csv, other apps made me lose my mind by how complicated the process was, this one has TONS of features and the devs are very helpful! A+
10	I never mind that can I find apps like this, it's really cooool 5/5 Thank you Team.
7	I use the application for two days! I needed two pixels at the same time. Everything works great. Without knowing English, I was able to set up in 10 minutes. I asked for help in support. I have a question about the operation of a pixel. After 5 minutes, they started a dialogue with me and helped. We checked the work, looked at all the reports. The price of the application pleased me. Similar applications have higher prices! Igor.
9	This is a fantastic app that is going to help me compete against the big guys in my industry.  Some brands that I sell have minimum internet pricing and I want to be able to sell those items lower than that without showing the prices on the product/collections pages.  Customer service is also fantastic, I emailed them and then 10 minutes later my request was taken care of.  I highly recommend this app.
9	Amazing and easy to use, the free plan is already powerful.Design is beautiful! Thank you for making this application!
6	Amazing!  The app developer took hours to help us customize the app to have other functionality and never gave up on us.  Love the app, and truly appreciate all the hard work they have done for our company!
10	Looks like it's a good app. :)
7	Good jog just add it to my store, I don't use it yet, but I love all the service you provide, good app by the way
8	This app does what it says. Needed to update a large number of customers about their delivery status. Worked like a charm. Online support was good too.
5	Team DataChamp are excellent with customer and technical support. Our business is happy to be working with them and finds this application useful for data management purposes. www.atozgadgets.uk recommends working with team DataChamp.
4	The last update is perfect now I can import from multi platforms .... and now I can import product variants image :D Thank you!!!!!
5	It can track page view data, but can't track checkout data and purchase data. What's the reason锛烪ope to be better.
7	This app is perfect for what I needed, we used to have to run Map pricing through a script that only worked by modifying code on collection, search and product templates.  Service was awesome and they customized everything I needed in a few days
7	The app is great and customer service is excellent!
5	Have to see how well this works. We are a startup looking for the right partner for our SEO. We have basic knowledge, now the right tools.
5	This is such a great app and just what I was looking for! The service was fantastic I was on a video call tutorial within minutes as I struggle with technology a bit. Couldn't recommend more!
6	This app does what it says well and is easily customizable, the support guys are really helpful and have even added another feature on request!
9	Tried because was free ... but sure is a Great job guys !!!! Easy, friendly and full of fields you can work outside shopify.
8	Perfect application to export any data from shopify to an excel or csv file, moreover it is possible to re-import the modified file to update the tracking numbers for example. Very fast customer service, barely 1 hour to answer me after a bad connection to my google drive. Thank you
5	Doesn't work. Installed this app, got a few sales and it didn't let the pixel track anything. The developer needs to look into this.
3	Site's homepage started taking long to load because it was waiting for code.jquery.com which may have something to do with this app. Also according to facebook pixel helper my main pixel was showing errors. Uninstalled app and rolled back theme.liquid and its now loading fast with no pixel issues. This app needs more work.
4	This was a much needed find for our store. With MAP restrictions threatening my sales, the app works perfectly.  The developer provided me assistance with installation and customization so that I can continue to compete.  Within an hour after installation, we received our first sale utilizing the app!
7	Love this app for various options. And the admin team who helped me for the minor technical error was very warm and helpful!
9	Easy to use, very effective way to promote your special offers for a daily time or special dates as well
5	inSites is an addictive app ;) The application does exactly what it says: it displays figures about each product or collection, when you are on that page. I have installed the application since it was beta. Easy to install, does not require customization, I see all the numbers I need, in real time, when browsing the shop. It is also very useful for reports that I cannot get otherwise: product conversions, sales and conversions for collections, hot or cold products ... Highly recommended.
4	Just installed the app ..................just hoping it will do what it say it will do increase traffic and sales
8	Works great and is super helpful for tracking unfufilled orders and even sending messages to your customers automatically. The creator even added extra features for me.
2	"We reached out to the developers about incorporating a ""test email"" feature, and they had it up and running within 48 hours. Great support! The only other thing I would love to see would be the option to add a logo or header to give the emails a less generic look. But otherwise, this app works well and is easy to use"
10	Support is good! ...................................................................................
10	that was super easy! :) I've only used it one time but so far so good. Will update review as necessary!
9	Outstanding product info and insights, just what I needed. Works a treat. Great support. Absolute bargain price too.
5	I used this app to help me keep on track better with my store.i really like how the app helps me keep on track
5	Very easy. Not looked at it yet, but was very simple to set up. If I hadn't had a couple of glases of wine, I could probably say something more useful :-)
4	I use this app for all my e-mails & have found the team SO helpful. I moved over from Mailchimp & loving the integration with Shopify. Really great to add the products straight to my e-mails when designing & track the activity with my store. The automation feature & scheduling are also great features. Aildih, Emma & Will deserve a massive shout out for answering all my many questions & being so helpful.
10	i love it
2	I just added this app., just now and it is very impressive. I just activated the button and it was up and running and it looks clean and great on my shop! I am very wowed. This was the easiest wish list app I have EVER added! So happy and excited! thanks to Listfully Wishlist/Developers, awesome app!
2	I have gotten so many requests from online and in-store shoppers for a wishlist. We decided on Listfully for two reasons. 1) because of its ease of use and integration in to our Shopify site. 2) I am an interior designer and aesthetics are incredibly important; the design of the Listfully app is just what I was looking for! Not only does it work great, it's clean and simple aesthetic fits in so well with the design of our shop. Try this out...you won't regret it!
9	Poor business ethics, I asked for assistance with setting up the app and the response was sure if you pay us $99 U.S, I have requested assistance in setting up other apps when on the free trial and have never been charged. They say reason they charge is because it takes a few hours to set up and people delete the app after the 30 day free trail!! Clearly told me everything I needed to know, Don't waist your time these guys just want your money!!
7	Great app and very good service from the team. Well worth it if you want to assist customers find what they're looking for!
5	No attempts needed. Just Install and see the difference. Had a gradual decline in customer, but when we did the email blast with Machine Lab, the responds was encouraging. Best of all, tried many others apps as well and this was one of the best with tons of features which most importantly is EASY TO USE. Well done!
5	Having used multiple mail apps, this is undoubtedly the best.  The design functionality is great, and the templates are brilliant. Also we find Shopify is quite limited with reporting our sales, and the dashboard within Machine Labs has made it so much easier to check our average order, sales volumes etc. Lastly we can easily track exactly how much each campaign makes, and we are delighted with the results!
4	Maisie AI is an excellent app for both customer support and sales conversion.  As soon as I implemented in my store, I was able to convert visitors who were about to exit to paying customers.  The integration with Facebook Messenger is slick and seamless, and the admin support from the app team is superb.  I highly recommend!
2	The app is really intuitive, very easy to navigate and get your campaign starting in no time, and the interface is very neat. The support team is also very attentive and reliable. Highly recommended.
6	LOVE THIS APP! It has the best design tools for creating our announcement banners. We can add links, emoji, custom code, etc. It's a really great app for designing and scheduling our announcements.
2	I highly recommend Machine Labs. It integrated easily with my shop, the dashboard and reports look great and are really informative. The email builder is very flexible and intuitive to use. The Machine Labs team were extremely responsive in fixing a couple of issues I ran into and they listened to feedback.
5	Cloop is one of the most interesting apps we've used. It gives us data on profit and customer type, which has changed how we're doing our Facebook and Google Ads.
5	A great tool for creating lists and segments. Tons of data and easy to use. Highly recommend to any e-com business looking to understand their audience and grow!
7	I am getting a request timeout when doing the submit? Yet can not  evaluate it. I hope they fix this.
5	Our team loves this app. We use it to generate hyper-targeted customer segments from our email and social marketing data. Great value for the price and their team is very helpful. Would recommend for any e-commerce business looking for a next-gen growth tool.
5	Incredibly powerful customer list and segmentation tool.  Exportable custom and smart segments for social marketing helped us get more bang for our buck with our prospecting, retargeting, and retention campaigns.
5	This app is really useful in getting all your data into one space whether it be related to ads or shopify performance. It helps me pinpoint where my weak points so I can focus on making those parts better
2	Great banner app, easy to use. Love the options of different banners for each page. Great support team.
5	I love the app. Their support has been very responsive and receptive to my needs and they are constantly adding new features to help my business grow. Absolutely recommend the app.
2	Nice and simple app to use. Look forward to capturing subscribers and using different banners for my pages.
2	I used this app to help me analize some data since I am new in all this! Definitely recommended!!! Gabe helped me so much with everything!
5	This application surpassed my initial expectations. I was able to add Google Analytics and Facebook Ads in a single report. Overall, this app helps you view all your data in a holistic view and determine which areas you'd need to improve to meet your conversion goals. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking to better understand their traffic data.
2	Very easy to install and I like the option of the bar being sticky at the bottom of the page so that you cand direct customers to shopping when they have scrolled down saving them from scrolling back up again!
7	I really like the option to schedule different banners. I'm new to CSS so needed a little extra help customizing the padding and customer service was really helpful and responsive! I like that I don't have to paste code into my theme editor either in order to update the CSS
5	Email app has sending issues, and only delivers to a portion of the total email list. Checking with support did not find an explanation. I added this as a potential future alternative. However I cannot recommend this app.
7	This app gave me the solution I needed for my announcement. CS got me finished in less than an hour. Thank you
9	I just downloaded this app and I have two things to say!  1. This is the best app for the solution it provides and I have checked others before trying this out. It definitely does what it says and the user interface is great. 2. The customer support by Dako was one of the best I have experienced in a while. He really took the time to help me customise the app to my needs and the output was great. For that it's easily a 5 STAR App. However, I would say it's definitely a little pricier than some other apps and I think decreasing the price by $2-3 would lead to more customers for them. Also the app is not prefect (yet) and could definitely improve to smooth out some of the functionalities.  To conclude, for what the app does and the customer service this app is definitely worth using.
7	Does what it's supposed to do quickly and easily. One minor issue which was quickly fixed. Good communication.
9	Don't miss this app, from start to finish setting up it was easy to understand! Really cheap to send messages. I recommend to try all the ecom owners!
5	This is currently the best analytics app on the Shopify App Store.  These are some of the best features I love: - It shows which items are added-to-cart most often: by having this data, you'd know which item is performing well and which is performing badly. - Items Frequently Purchased Together: you can easily increase your Average Order Value (AOV) by upselling customers using this data. Normally, you need to be using the Shopify Plan ($79USD/month) or the Advanced Shopify Plan($299USD/month) to access these data, but with the UI Ave Analytics App, you can access them for free, or with a really small amount of money.
9	Appy is very easy to install and use! The free app is great but for $4.99, it is inexpensive enough to pay monthly for all of the features Appy offers.
5	Nice app helps me a lot without any coding required, Thanks a lot
7	This is an update of my first review: i contacted again the support and they told me there were native problems caused by the theme and Orbis Lab they have fix them in one day. Now it's seems there are no more errors.
5	"Am I missing something? I cannot send emails to anyone but my ""email subscribers"" list which doesn't include customers that have signed up through the pop up app that I use to collect customer's emails. Which seems to be the most effective way of getting emails so I do not want to quit using it. But with no way to email them through this app, it makes BOTH apps pointless. I have reached out for help and was told to use the pop up apps option to have them automatically respond when a customer signs up. Okay great, but what about after that? I can never email them again? If I am just not doing something right someone please tell me !!! I cannot figure it out!"
5	all the mails are going in junk, it pretty useless for us. please try to do some thing with this.
2	I'm looking for a sliding announcement bar and this is the one. Good for now, I need to find more features of it.
5	I love this app. The app is Amazing. I love the app. Great app. Fixed issues right away. I love app
8	It a great help for fulfilling the orders and entering tracking details. The app saves a lot of time for us. Recommend it to everyone.
5	It's really easier than other apps here... You just import your contacts and start sending messages, IN JUST SEVERAL clicks!! the prices are cheaper too, I like it
4	I can use EMAILS, I can send SMS messages and WhatsApp, and it's all cheap!!!! I'm happy, guys! Thank you so much
2	UI Ave has helped me gain better insights into where opportunities for improvement in my business are. I can set goals for myself and use the app to track my performance. The app is super easy to use and I would highly recommend it for anyone.
5	Quite simple to use even for me who is not tech minded at all. Love you can upgrade or downgrade plan any times and have  banners disabled or scheduled.
10	Love being able to easily add a banner! I will probably upgrade soon. Great support, I highly recommend!!
5	"I love the idea of Shopify Email, but this is way too basic for our needs.  I was hoping it would be similar or better than the old Mailchimp/Shopify integration, but it doesn't even come close. There are both basic and advanced features that are missing.  Here are some missing features:  -2 and 3 column sections -sections that allow you to add your choice of standard content blocks (buttons, text, images, products, etc.). That works so much better than relying on finding a pre-made template that has all the right content blocks. -the ability to add images! Logo and products are the only images that can be added to emails now. -use Paragraph, Header 1, Header 2, etc. for text instead of fiddling with the size continually. Very important for those of us that have blog posts we share through email. I like that you can change the text size, but it's set up in a way that doesn't work for long text blocks. -there's something weird with the ""from"" section in the email designer. It should be possible to add alternate emails rather than just the main store email. -it's great to be able to add products, but what about collections? It would be more useful for us to be able to add a collection and pull a certain number of those products into the email or simply a collection image and link -automated emails, ideally with the option of automated email sequences (welcome emails, thank you emails, abandoned cart emails, email sequences triggered by tags/shopping behavior/birthday/custom date field, reengagement campaigns, etc.) -custom fields. We use Mailchimp as a CRM where we have additional information about our customers like birthday, custom date fields, interests, etc. Currently there is no option for this in Shopify. -ability to send emails to people who have purchased (or not yet purchased) specific products. In general, customer group filters are not sophisticated enough. -Shopify is in a unique position to be able to pull off personalized recommended product emails based on customer behavior. That would be a amazing to see here. I could see this working for businesses that are just getting off the ground or have only a handful of products. For now, it is not useable for us. But I'm hoping that Shopify Email will grow to include some of these features. I would much rather use Shopify in the future if it's able to up its email game. Edit: Forgot to mention merge fields, discount codes and email scheduling in the list of missing features. I'm also concerned by some reviews mentioning the app hurting their sender reputation and even blacklisting domains. Those reviews may be overblown, but there doesn't seem to be an effective way of managing list cleaning, authorizing send emails, etc."
2	Amazing App! Very intuitive and easy to use. Set up on my store at the click of a button! Hopefully my customers enjoy!
2	Worst fulfillment I literally have ever seen. They don't even have the correct headers available to select from? Are you serious how did this even make it to the app store wtf. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP.
2	I have just started using it recently and I can see the results already! A great help to my business. Easy to set up and the support is really helpful!! Thank you
9	We use their other app Sales & Discount and got an email about their latest one. As the app is free to use we thought we would try it on our store and have not been disappointing. The free features are decent and it's not a lot to get the paid one.
7	It has great customer service. Best plugin for the snippet. Use for best e-commerce seo. If u want to another service you can pay for it
2	Quick and easy! Thanks for doing the work for me ( that i couldn't figure out on my own!) It only took a few minutes :)
5	I was looking for an easy way to provide short promo URLs in print, and this easy little app does the job perfectly!
6	This app is amazing. Not only is there an option to create an email campaign from a blank template, there is also a great selection of templates to use. There is no limit to how many subscribers either like there is on Mailchimp. Highly recommended!
9	It literally sends emails to the most simple schedule ever. It does nothing of any use. What are you charging for? Something as simple as this should be free across all plans!
5	I am a big fan of this app. Works perfect for a top announcement bar and the countdown to free shipping really encourages my customers. Highly recommended!
2	I wanted a fast & simple, responsive, action and notification bar. I have tried many! This one stand out by FAR. It's also highly customisable and user friendly
7	Love it! Exactly what I needed. Works as advertised and offers good customer support. Recommend it to everyone.
7	If you like the app, you will love their customer service...................................................
2	Great app. Easy to use, took 30 mins to set up everything. Support is with you every step of the way! Highly recommend! Now i just have to wait for Google to catch up!
6	Have been using Zegsu for 2 of my Shopify sites and it been close to 2 months. Its easy to use and works perfectly! The best part is they provide insights/analytics on the number of clicks on a particular custom short URL you have prepared for a specific product, collection or a page! I love Zegsu and would recommend everyone who are looking through scale their products to multi-channel advertisements.
6	App designed a great digital catalog for our store.  App was easy to use as well, I tried several others prior without the same success.  Definitely worth the download and saved me a headache.
2	Great app. Does exactly what I need. I wasn't sure if it would be able to calculate how far a away a customer was from the free shipping threshold, but it does. Their support team is also friendly and help. If you need a announcement bar at the top of your store, this one is perfect.
5	i use this to include a timer for my online store to go live, this was so easy to install and also a live member walk me through it.. thanks!!!!!
4	I love using this app, it supports MANY languages and SMS Automations are pretty easy to use and helpful. Would definitely recommend!!
5	This app has a lot of useful marketing features. I really love the automated WhatsApp SMS abandon cart functionality the most! Its convenient to have all of this functionality in one dashboard .
5	If you're looking for BEST SEO App, look no further. SEO by Google Rich Snippet is best of all. Affordable and works like a charm. Thank you guys for developing such an amazing App.
5	This is the easiest app I've found to generate a PDF catalog of my Shopify store products - I created a catalog for my products in two minutes, having spent hours trying to work out other apps and getting lost in complex configuration. I'm glad I found Easy Catalogs and will be using it every month to produce up-to-date product catalogs for my customers. I would highly recommend this app..
5	I used this app to create PDF catalogs and send them via email. It's amazing! You can easily share catalog links anywhere and no need to upload/download... There are only 6 templates but support tells us that they work on more templates to provide... 5 STARS!
5	good pricing but the delivery rate is quite poor when compared to previous email app we have used it the past. I believe there will be future improvements.
5	This is a great app to send out SMS to customers. This app is also useful to send abandoned cart reminders to my customers who didn't get to the checkout process and those who didn't complete the checkout process. Highly recommend to all Shopify store owners!
4	I used these apps for my dropshipping business. Displays links to pages it considers relevant and authoritative. Authority is mostly measured by analyzing the number and quality of links from other web pages.
5	Sent out first email last week. Love the integration to my store and how I can pull in my products, content, etc directly to my email.  Please add automated email capability. I want to send email to new email subscribers, new customers, tagged customers, etc.
5	AI and Machine Learning might seem like complicated topics, especially for e-commerce managers, but the team at MorphL made the on-boarding process smooth for us and having their predictions integrated on our website was pretty straight forward. So far we've used two of their machine learning models (shopping stage prediction and cart abandonment) and got positive results: X3 conversion rate for users identified as being promising. I am excited to really build out our experience with their other machine learning models: churning users and personalized recommendations are top of mind. Deciding to partner with MorphL was one of the best things we did this year. They continue to be responsive in making sure we have the AI capabilities we need.
7	The app is really cool and easy to use.  I needed a little help from them at first, and their service was fantastic.
5	*UPDATE* After several emails from the developer on the issues I was having, they are now fixing and tweeking things. They are very attentive to requests and concerns. I'm impressed with the diligence to make things work for us shop owners. Upgraded stars on customer support!  This app gives me a headache. I can't get it to work correctly. Not that there are easy steps. Won't save inactive autoposts, no short links, which is a huge disappointment. Shows preview in HTML so many glitches and no online support chat. Have to send an email and wait. This is not for me.
5	Great Customer service with quick e-mail response. I havent seen the benefits of this app yet but i'm confident it will boost my sales.
10	I like it was pretty self-explanatory. I like the app and definitely would recommend it to others. Thanks
7	I really like this Tier App, it is part of our strategy to drive up AOV to use bundles and Tier is very easy to implement and has paid for itself in the first day we implemented it. Good value, great product, and their customer service (dom) is a very nice guy that was helpful.
2	Very good application for launching a new shop or for a beginner, unfortunately not compatible with the ajax shopping cart of the supply theme, so I will uninstall it reluctantly. The support is very reactive.
7	Great app and great customer service! I really appreciate their quality support and the upsell app is really useful to get more sale; I like the app, great experience
5	very useful, but there is a problem. it only async 92 products. new products could not be push. fixed this issue, may be better.
4	Wonderful support. They were able to get into my store with my permission and fix compatibility issues between Tier and my theme.
9	Very useful app, user-friendly  and easy to use. It saves tons of time. And it's free ( which is great for small business, especially during the COVID). Definitely recommend.
10	Very useful app, and time con-saving ! Now you can delete the post, directly from FB . Good Luck !
10	Was looking for an easy app that did what I needed and this was perfe t for that! Support is amazing, would recommend!
2	i really love this app!, but i need chanche the text for auto scheduling, 'couse is very complicated change one by one...
5	Amazing app with unprecedented functionality. The support was very responsive and helped solve all the issues quickly.
5	Great app, easy to use, quick insallation and awesome support team! I have had troubles with the native search engine but this app fixed it.
4	I was so happy to find this app! It makes it much easier and convenient to publish my products and content from my store on Facebook automatically. It saves me a lot of time as I can also schedule the posts. It is a very useful app I much recommend!
4	I used Onollo to publish products from my store on Facebook automatically. Very convenient! I don't need to upload a separate photo and description, I don't spend my time on it anymore. Also, I usually choose the most active time for publishing and Onollo uploads the product when I need it. Very useful. I'm happy
7	Our initial minor problems with this app and our theme were quickly sorted out. Great support in a friendly manner. After trying quite a few alternatives, Tier fits the bill for us and we're happy to pay the very reasonable subscription fee to support the developers.
6	This app is amazing. It provides just enough of customization without being confusing or annoying. You can easily enable or disable the features that you want to use as well as customize the look. The admins also provided with some enhanced customization for our store.
4	I installed Onollo to help me to unload some work with my Facebook page. Even though I haven't launched my store yet, I already had a great experience with these guys. Super quick responses, Artin and Alex go beyond regular customer service. They spent a good hour with me explaining the product and social media best practices. Great app and great people behind it.
7	I downloaded 5 other apps today in an attempt to offer the opportunity for my customers to add the same product in different lengths while achieving the discount. There were so many problems with the others because they either failed to offer the proper functionality, the app itself was confusing, the app didn't install correctly, or it drastically slowed down my site. TIER was the shining light in the midst of chaos. It was an absolutely seamless installation that matches my site's design perfectly without me having to customize anything. Creating the bundles was easy and it's exactly what I wanted. The option to swap particular products is something I didn't know that I needed but I'm glad that I have. There was an issue that was quickly resolved by Dom who answered the question, customized the integration with my store, and was incredibly patient/kind/knowledgeable. I am planning to start another store soon and if there is an opportunity to use this app, I will do so in a heartbeat. Thanks Dom for making my customers' experiences better!
9	Free good, not officially used, first set to see the effect. Hope to be helpful to sales transformation.
7	This is an amazing app that solves a problem many merchants don't even know about. I've only accidentally downloaded it, and the app has been generating me extra revenue since day 1. And the developers are helpful, too! 100% Recommend!
2	The app is easy to use and easy to setup. Support is very responsive and helpful. This app assures me that I won't lose a sale because of an out of sight add to cart button.
10	Amazing product - this has helped our store significantly and we would highly recommend! Thank you.
7	I've been looking for something like this for ages! It is so easy to set up your bundles, I'm confident that this app will increase my AOV. Initially I had an issue with my theme and contacted support, they had it up and running and made some custom adjustments for me within hours. Highly recommend.
5	Perfect app for creating your own bundles and tiered discounts. Does exactly what I needed and struggled to find within other paid apps. They have also provided super fast and helpful support! A great functional app for making more complex products, I'm very happy with it!

6	Still setting up my store, and after initially paying for another search app, I made the decision to try Instant Search.   Their aesthetic really suits my type of store, and the custom settings provide you with so many options.  I am new to all of this, and am so happy I found this app.
7	This is an excellent search app, which they have well designed functions to help merchant to uplift customer's online searching experience. Furthermore, they have one of the best customer services supports to provide valuable advise, as well as willing to linkup other App owner to resolve my challenges. Well Done ED!

5	I recently completely changed my theme and inquired with Instant Search to update the code.  That same day they were done.  Thankfully it was an easy fix for them.  I've enjoyed the facet search capabilities that IS has to offer.  I've also been able to tailor and customize the search to look more like my website.  Ton of features and endless variants can be added with tags.  I also enjoy the analytics which helps me to refine and adjust words to make the searching easier for customers.  Redirect option when certain search words are entered is a wonderful feature as well.  As mentioned there are a ton of options and features too many to list.
10	I recommend this app, I searched a lot and finally got into this one. Great App, support and service.

5	"This app is really terrific! Exceptionally easy to to use and a really amazing support team. This is a great option for anyone that supplies parts or needs to ""drill down"" to get to the correct item. They have improved the search so you can find by a variety of data points. I'm not a CSS guy and I was having an issue integrating it into my site gracefully. I asked them if they could help and within 24 hours the search was beautifully installed on my site exactly as I wanted. Really great support. NexusMedia really is a top tier developer. We will be looking at their other apps to see how we can enhance the rest of the website."
